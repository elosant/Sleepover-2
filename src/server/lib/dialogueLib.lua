-- TODO:
-- 1. dialogue should usually be kept in seperate modules, containing some logic if something needs to be computed at run time (random/only player for example)
-- 2. signals to voting/dialogue choice/team choice can be fired through the [e] stage direction
-- 3. send dialogue content to each machine, evaluate stage directions respective to each machine type.
-- 4. Random is a reserved speaker name used to pick a random player
-- 5. images will be fetched from an endpoint if the speaker is a player (a descendant of the players service), or its name is attributed to a field in assetPool
-- 6. if a speaker is an npc and can be found in the Speakers folder in workspace, a text billboard will be rendered locally as the text is parsed on the client
-- 7. only a server/client lib, client data and controller are needed

-- Not necessarily a stage direction, rather whether or not the word begins with
-- [ and ends with ].
